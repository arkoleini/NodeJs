When you want to push changes to GitHub, use:


git push origin your_branch_name
And to push changes to AWS CodeCommit, use:


git push codecommit your_branch_name
Keep in mind that you'll need to manage both remotes and their respective branches separately.
 Make sure to pull and merge changes from both remotes regularly to keep your local repository in sync with both remote repositories.





 AWS CodeCommit:  https://git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/NodeJS-BackEnd-Test1
